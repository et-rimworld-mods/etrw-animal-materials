Even after the patch that removed many leather types, I felt like the game had too many leathers.
Many were almost identical in stats, but different enough to make me want to min-max them.
In theory, that would be an interesting little puzzle.
However, another problem with the base game, is that most leathers are completely out-classed by a few good leathers, 
or devilstrand, which is relatively easy to grow.
Thus, most leathers in the game are effectively clutter, that you need to work around constantly.
I've removed, renamed, or reworked all the leathers, so that there's less of them total.

Another problem in the base game, is patchleather.
The only reason for it to be in the game, is so that players can consolidate different piles of leather,
which are otherwise too small to make a piece of clothing from.
Since I'm removing several leathers, this need is lessened.
Additionally, the stats for patchleather are so bad, that no player would ever want to use it, 
except perhaps if they need to make items to sell.
(It's got worse stats than lightleather, which are already very bad.)
The stat-penalty makes sense in a general sense, since if the player could combine worse leathers to make a better one,
they would never use the other leathers.
Instead of downgrading to a useless leather, I'm adding new patchleather recipes, which are less harsh,
but require leathers of similar quality.
For example, combining Thrumbo, Sloth, and Bear leather (all very strong) would produce leather about equal to Bear
(roughly the weakest of the "strong" leathers).

Animals which produce wools now no longer have special leathers.
You can either butcher them for wool and some plainleather, or keep them alive to sheer wool.
This was partly to remove clutter, but also because it seemed weird, that I could harvest hairs from an alive animal,
but when butchered the hairs stayed attached to their skin somehow.
It also differentiates them more from animals whose hide is thick enough, or the hairs short enough,
that the hairs are always attached to the hide, like wolf pelts or bear hides.

Lastly, birds give down feathers in addition to leather when they are butchered.
This can be used instead of cloth or wool for some recipes.
