- leather colors?
    - there's already other mods to add colors...
    - adding as separate leathers or sub-defs will clog up UI again
        - categories / filters might help
    - do this with stuff-properties in a "clothing-dye", and stuff-categories and stuff for the recipe?
        - but the base recipes use "stuff" to get colors directly from the leathers, so these will need to be replaced
        - also, this should go in another mod, since it's *adding* complexity, and this mod is *removing*
        - but the armor, color, and temperature values are all tied up in "stuff" for clothing
            - so I'd need to lock down either the armor or temperature values :C
- down feathers?
    - cloth + down for cheaper recipes, decent temperature, but garbage combat stats
    - use in:
        - jackets
        - parkas
        - tuques...?
        - beds?
        - sleeping rolls?
    - this would be a separate mod for new recipes?
        - conditional mod-check with patch-checks?
